<h2 >Furniture Donation Pickup Requirements</h2><p><h3> What you can donate</h3><p>The most important thing to consider when determining whether something is eligible for donation or not is its condition. Most donation centers require donated goods to be in good working condition and free of any tears, stains, cracks, or strong odors. </p><p><h3>What you can’t donate</h3></p><p>That said, if something is in poor shape or has been defaced by your cat, for example, it will likely be refused by the donation recipient. Some organizations also have rules and restrictions on the type of furniture they’ll accept. Goodwill, for instance, does not take mattresses or box springs. Once you’ve decided where to donate your furniture, be sure to double check their donation requirements.</p></div></div>
<h2>The Benefits of Donating Furniture</h2><p>Choosing to donate your furniture benefits both you and the environment. You can even get a little money for your contribution! So long as you keep the receipt, you can claim your furniture donation pickup or drop off on your tax return. Donating also avoids the risk of any fines associated with leaving your unwanted furniture on the curb. </p>
 <h2>	 What to keep in mind when donating furniture<h2>
<h3>Tax write-offs </h3> Don’t forget that your donations are tax deductible. Once you drop off the furniture, the organization should be able to provide you with a tax receipt that day. Come tax season, these receipts will help you save a bundle.
<h3>The condition of your items </h3> We hate to break it to you, but charity organizations won’t accept just anything. Your items will need to be in somewhat good shape. If you’re unsure about whether your item is in good enough shape to donate, I recommend contacting the charity directly to ask. Most donation sites provide a list of items they do and do not accept on their website. A few examples of items that most likely won’t be accepted anywhere include: Upholstered items with rips, stains, tears, and/or pet odors; hazardous materials/chemicals; unframed mirrors or glass; broken glass; storm windows and single pane windows; metal blinds; corner tubs; cultured marble tubs; broken flooring; lighting that doesn’t work; encyclopedias and textbooks; and electronics that are out of date.
