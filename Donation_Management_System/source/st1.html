	<h3 style="font-size:20">Run For a Cause Reloaded.</h3>
<p class="blabla">
    RFC reloaded was back the following year to drive the darkness away from the lives of the residents of Chevella Mandal. It was held on 27th March, 2016 and at the same venue as that of the last year. We were only received with greater love and warmth, the crowd sensed our ambitions and around 7k people contributed to our cause.
Installation of solar street lights and distribution of solar lamps did drive the darkness away from their homes.

	<h3>Run For a Cause 3.0</h3>
<p class="blabla">The legacy continued with RFC 3.0 held at People's plaza on 26thMarch, 2016, the grandest of them all, with a massive turnout of 15,000 runners. We aimed to transform the lives of those in Lendiguda, a remote tribal village in Adilabad that hadn't had a beacon of hope until we stepped up. A large scale project of installation of solar street lights, panels and distribution of solar lamps is currently undertaken</p>

<h3>Run 4 a Cause</h3>


<p class="blabla">It was around this time of the year when we had sweat to quench the thirst of distant strangers;  of men who had long forsaken their right to humane treatment.</p>

<p class="blabla">And we marched, under the summer sun, to quench their thirst for humanity.</p>

<p class="blabla">Now, if you were to think, that was all we had in service for humanity, wait to be proven wrong.</p>

<p class="blabla">Run 4 a Cause, coming soon......</p>
